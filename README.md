# Surface Crack Detection

## Overview
This repository contains the resources and notebook for the INFO 6105 final project focused on Surface Crack Detection using machine learning. The project aims to demonstrate the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other machine learning techniques to detect surface cracks in concrete structures, which is crucial for assessing structural health and integrity.

## Contents
- `SurfaceCrackDetection-Pre.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation detailing the project scope, dataset analysis, machine learning models evaluated, and findings.
- `Final Term Project.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that includes the code for dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations. To avoid academic integrity issues, it will not be uploaded online. Please contact the author if you need a reference.

## Project Description
The project explores various machine learning methods to identify and classify surface cracks in concrete. It involves steps such as:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Preparing and augmenting the dataset for optimal machine learning application.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its characteristics and prepare it for model training.
- **Model Training and Testing**: Implementing and evaluating different models, primarily focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Techniques like Dropout, Data Augmentation, and Batch Normalization have been implemented to enhance the model's generalization.
